## Experience

### Samsung Research and Development  
**Machine Learning Engineer - Full-time | OnDevice AI Team**  
*Bengaluru, India | August 2023 - Present*  

- **Data Science & Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
  - Developed a relationship prediction model using conversational and behavioral data (e.g., calls, missed calls, messages), leveraging ML techniques, data preprocessing, and advanced NLP models (LSTM, BI-LSTM, BERT), achieving **95% accuracy** across 7 classes. Innovation led to a **granted patent**.
  - Designed and implemented an **OCR text denoising solution** using encoder-decoder architectures (RNN, Transformer), improving text recognition accuracy by **91%**.

- **Computer Vision (CV):**
  - Contributed to the development of **Screen AI and AI Select** technologies using on-screen object detection (e.g., timestamps, keyboards, maps) with YOLO, achieving an **inference time of 150ms** and reducing the model size from **20MB to 1.5MB**.
  - Integrated the optimized UI element detection model into the **On-Device Context Retriever (ODCR)** module, reducing textual noise and enhancing entity extraction (phone numbers, emails, addresses, URLs), enabling smart suggestions.

- **Generative AI:**
  - Developed **Generative AI solutions** for summarization and translation, leveraging LLMs for **Bixby‚Äôs Android integration**, enhancing user interaction capabilities and language understanding.

### Samsung Research and Development  
**Software Developer Engineer - Intern | OnDevice AI Team**
